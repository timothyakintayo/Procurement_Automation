## Business Problem
Traditional procurement systems like Organizations struggle with manual purchase 
## Introduction
This project is a Purchase Request & Approval System built with Microsoft's Power Platform. It is a low-cost no-code procurement system enabling organizations using Microsoft365 to seamlessly make procurements with the help of an end-to-end procurement automation with approvals & reporting. It enables users to submit purchase requests via the PowerApps which is available for tablet and phones. The application stores data in sharepoint and automates approvals using Power Automate, notifying staffs via emails and microsoft teams about requests in three categories which are:
* Request for Laptop
* Request for Office Supplies
* Request for other Equipment
In addition, the application consists of a home screen where these three sections can be navigated to, back buttons which allows you to go back to the previous request section alongside a home button to navigate to the home screen and a submit button which allows you to automatically submit your request in the application, sending the request to the stakeholders in the organization with a first to respond option enabled, making the approval system easy without waiting on a specific individual.
